### Setting up
You need `node` and `npm` at least. From there `npm install && cd web/ && npm install` sets up the package dependencies.

### Running
Web code needs to be packed, so first (and after any modifications to `web/*`) run `npm run build`. If all goes well you have web files in `web/dist/`. Then start the server with `npm run start`.
